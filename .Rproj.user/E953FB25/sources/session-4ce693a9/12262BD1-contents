## Homework 15 feedback
Nice work using heading levels to keep things looking nice in your document.

In code block lines 20-21, you don't actually need those lines, beccause line 18 `library(tidyverse)` also loads the dplyr and ggplot2 packages.

You did a nice job commenting your code within code chunks and also making some notes/jotting down what you are doing outside of code chunks.

regarding line 159 - I'm glad!
